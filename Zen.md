# Prelude
According to Wikipedia The term Zen is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the Middle Chinese word 禪 (chán), an abbreviation of 禪那 (chánnà), which is a Chinese transliteration of the Sanskrit word ध्यान dhyāna ("meditation"). 
Zen emphasizes rigorous self-restraint, meditation-practice and insight, "perceiving the true nature" of oneself as Buddha-mind (bodhicitta and Buddha-nature), and the personal expression of this insight in daily life for the benefit of others.

In Pop culture is used quite interchangably with a sense of peace and calm, a harmony with nature, a harmony with oneself.
There are several online videos, tutorials, books, etc. Telling you how to acheive Zen. Be one with the Earth, acheive enlightenment. So what am I doing writing about it? Well I am the advocate to the opposite, I am here to advise you against it. 

# The Road to Zen
The key to understanding as to why you would like to accept a hypothesis is to understand what cons it's counterhypothesis presents. 
Say, some person comes to you to convince you that the Earth is flat. Now as a logical entity of the cosmos you are not to accept or deny the credibilty of any theory unless you have collected data and evidence.
You may go by the way the Ancients did and say that the eclipses won't be possible and we would see a line shadow, or you cannot explain the difference in the length of the shadows of a stick at the same time of the day, or you may get yourself a spaceship and directly look at the Earth from above and go HA HA it's round. I don't want to go on and on, this is not a flat earth debunking piece. The point is any theory demands evidence and counter examples to prove or disprove them. So to advocate against Zen, we need to look at the previous research done on this topic. And who better than the single greatest psychoanalyst to ever live, the first awesome dude who questioned the human psyche and derived conclusions. It's the one, the only Siddhhartha aka **Gautama Budhha**. (It's not Freud you dumb f@#ks, your mind always wanders to dirty things don't they?)

# Prince Siddhartha
Well the first person to truly analyse human suffering was Siddhartha, born in Lumbini, present day Nepal, the apparent heir of the Shakya clan. The causality of the universe works in strange ways and according to legend, his parents tried to protect him from suffering and misery and it turn made it seem so weird and fascinating when he first realised it exists at the third decade of his life with a wife and kids that it fried his mind on a fundamental level.
The thing must have hit him so bizzarely as the Michelson–Morley experiment must have hit the 20th century science nuts!! So this absolute unit of a human, this giga chad decides to up go into the wilderness and learn the true meaning of life, the true cause of suffering. The original sin so as to speak. And boy he gets a taste of what he was looking for.
So long story short, and finding himself suffering immensely, he caves in and decides to eat the rice porridge that the fair lady offers him that he becomes ENLIGHTENED. He gains cosmic wisdom and comes up with the **Madhyam Marg**. I don't know what version of this story you all hear in the west but I live a few hundreds of kilometres from the very tree he gained this enlightenment and this is the version that has been circulating among my people.
My man was so popular that even when he founded his own belief club (Religion), the neighbouring dominant religion (Hinduism) decided that his teachings are actually a part of their own and even declared him as the Ninth Avatar, though this is slightly disputed based on who you ask. Any ways, that's some successful research that your research gets funded by your competing company. I told you, my man was an absolute unit.

# Buddha's Abstract
So what did my esteemed predecessor have to say. Well the abstract of his thesis would read something like this:
> We have concluded that to be born into this **World** (_Sangsara_) as a conscious being is the source of all misery. For consciousness creates **Want** (_Trishna_) and **Dissatisfaction** (_Ashantosh_) comes when the wants are not fulfilled. This eventually leads to **Misery** (_Dukhha_). Hence the only way to prevent misery and dissatisfaction is to control our wants. We shouldn't confuse our wants with needs and should not deprive ourselves of sustenance and things that bring us joy. This balance between greed and satisfaction is the **Middle Path** (_Madhyam Marga_) and walking this path will allow enlightenment.

Now I don't want to sound like a fanboy or anything, but man that sounds convincing. If my man was a modern human and this fact wasn't known, I would nominate him for Nobel Prize in Medicine, Peace and Economics all at once. I can't add anything more or better on this line of reasoning. If you find this to be the absolute truth and don't wish to hear any counter arguments, I respect that. You may want to reaffirm your beliefs by watching this [exurb1a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2wLyhgeYsw). 

But my dear reader/viewer, you know what we are going to do next don't you? As good scientists, we shall question this hypothesis and see if it holds up. 
So let's segway to the sponsor of all of my hopes and dreams. Mr. Freeman Dyson.
